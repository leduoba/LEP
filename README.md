The source codes are based on the paper in BMVC 2015: segmenting natural images with the least effort as humans (http://bmvc2015.swansea.ac.uk/proceedings/papers/paper110/paper110.pdf or https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280039751_Segmenting_Natural_Images_with_the_Least_Effort_as_Humans).

The segmentation algorithm obtains the state-of-the-art performance both on boundary- and region- measures on BSDS500.

Please cite the paper if you want to use the source codes in your work. Also, any suggestions or bug reports will be highly appreciated.
