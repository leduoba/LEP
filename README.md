Source codes for the BMVC 2015 paper: segmenting natural images with the least effort as humans

The source codes are based on the paper in BMVC 2015: segmenting natural images with the least effort as humans.

The segmentation algorithm obtains the state-of-the-art performance both on boundary- and region- measures on BSDS500.
